## Overview
This project is a Spotify analysis dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into track plays, user behavior, and platform preferences. It consists of two main pages: **Overview** and **Details**.

## Features
- **Track Statistics**: Displays year-to-date (YTD), prior year-to-date (PYTD), month-to-date (MTD), and track differences.
- **Listening Trends**:
  - Tracks played by week number
  - Tracks played by day of the week
  - Tracks played by month
- **Platform Analysis**: Shows the distribution of track plays across different platforms such as Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Web Player, and Cast devices.
- **User Behavior**:
  - Tracks skipped vs. not skipped
  - Tracks played in shuffle mode vs. non-shuffle mode
- **Detailed Breakdown**:
  - Lists track details, including artist name, platform, date, time, reason for starting playback, and total minutes played.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Power BI file (if available) to explore the dataset further.
3. Use filters to analyze track plays based on different criteria (date, platform, artist, etc.).

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Improve the visualization with more interactive charts.
- Implement machine learning models to predict user listening behavior.
